People with disabilities have generally poorer health, lower education achievements, fewer economic opportunities and higher rates of poverty than people without disabilities. This is largely due to the lack of services available to them and the many obstacles they face in their everyday lives. The report provides the best available evidence about what works to overcome barriers to health care, rehabilitation, education, employment, and support services, and to create the environments which will enable people with disabilities to flourish. The report ends with a concrete set of recommended actions for governments and their partners. This pioneering World report on disability will make a significant contribution to implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. At the intersection of public health, human rights and development, the report is set to become a "must have" resource for policy-makers, service providers, professionals, and advocates for people with disabilities and their families.},

The use of Web accessibility heuristics in heuristic evaluations can ensure that a greater range of special needs will be considered, from visual to cognitive impairments. Key advantages of heuristics are conciseness, memorablity, meaningfulness and insight. The heuristics can be used effectively to understand which areas of a site have accessibility issues and can provide useful insight into how to create a solution. However, the heuristics will not tell evaluators whether a Web site conforms to legislation. Studies have confirmed the common belief that heuristics should not replace knowledge but act to cue the deeper body of knowledge defined by the guidelines; it is essential that evaluators be given accessibility education before completing a heuristic evaluation using the accessibility heuristics.},

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose a set of principles for the conduct of critical research in information systems. We examine the nature of the critical research perspective, clarify its significance, and review its major discourses, recognizing that its mission and methods cannot be captured by a fixed set of criteria once and for all, particularly as multiple approaches are still in the process of defining their identity. However, we suggest it is possible to formulate a set of principles capturing some of the commonalities of those approaches that have so far become most visible in the {IS} research literature. The usefulness of the principles is illustrated by analyzing three critical field studies in information systems. We hope that this paper will further reflection and debate on the important subject of grounding critical research methodology.},

The development is instead seen as the most important part of the development process, and developers take design decisions on their own, many times based on a limited understanding, or disregard, of the design as a whole. Prototypes, sharing work place, and structured communication is said to improve collaboration. Overall however, the understanding among developers for design work is perceived as low.

Practices employed by recognized Norwegian professionals on {UD} of {ICT} systems are studied through survey research. An online survey is used. Non-probabilistic stepwise selection identifies a local sample of 70 profiled professionals. A bottom-up, inductive and emergent approach is used for analyzing method usage and methodological approaches. Correlations are investigated. Results indicate Norwegian professionals overall use cross-method user-centered universal design, with direct user contact. Results also highlight the large overlap between {UD} and user-centered design ({UCD}). Personal factors and external values influence method selection more than external constraints – somewhat contradicting the perception that budget is the main key to ensuring {UD} and supporting the assumption that methodological competence is important for ensuring {UD} quality. Personal factors affecting approach and method selection are not necessarily linked to epistemologies or methodological stances, as initially assumed, but rather to the importance placed on user-involvement. The main influencing external factor is normative emphasis on {UD} value. Future work will focus on identifying success factors for universal design, and utilizing the knowledge in tools supporting universal design quality ({UD}-Q) control.},

Web content accessibility standards and guidelines have been created, and specific legislation is in place in several countries to further UD. However, there are limited insights into the actual practices regarding successful implementation of UD in ICT-projects. This study aims to provide such insights through an interview study with 13 individuals affiliated with 12 ICT-projects that have been successful in ensuring UD. The data from the interviews is analyzed in-depth through a thematic analysis, in search for theoretical interpretations that may generate the basis for a proposed best practice for UD in ICT-projects. Our data identify 13 promoting and 6 obstructive factors related to the implementation of UD, spanning three levels - organizational, process and individual. Our findings both coincide and expand previous research findings. The study highlights the link between user-centered design, usability focus and universal design. On process level, early and continuous focus on UD and usability, in iterative approaches, with frequent quality assurance and user contact, and interdisciplinary collaboration seems to be good practice. Our findings emphasize the importance and influence of having a solid anchoring of UD at all levels (a “UD culture”), as well as individual competences and personal qualities of team members and stakeholders. Main findings are summarized in six factors; “UD anchoring”, “UD competence”, “Focus”, “Collaboration”, “Iterative process” and “QA (Quality Assurance)”. Future work aim to verify findings, model practice factors, contribute towards reliable best practices and design a tool indicating the UD maturity of a project.},

{METHODS}: Literature review, synthesized with the authors' research and practice experiences.
{RESULTS}: The authors suggest an instrumental, three-step definition to accessibility, highlighting that accessibility comprises a personal as well as a environmental component, and that accessibility must be analysed by an integration of both. Suggesting the introduction of an activity component, accessibility should partly be replaced by the more complex term usability. Universal design is highlighted as a more process-oriented but less stigmatizing concept.
{CONCLUSION}: This paper contributes to the positioning and definition of concepts describing person-environment relationships. The definitions suggested challenge current terminology, but can support in developing more efficient research and practice strategies. In order to develop theory for application to societal planning issues, the definition of concepts is a necessary step.},

Drawing on thinkers from Aristotle to Simone Weil, by way of Aquinas, Kant, Rilke, Nietzsche, Spinoza, and Rawls, among others, Comte-Sponville elaborates on the qualities that constitute the essence and excellence of humankind. Starting with politeness-almost a virtue-and ending with love-which transcends all morality-A Small Treatise takes us on a tour of the eighteen essential virtues: fidelity, prudence, temperance, courage, justice, generosity, compassion, mercy, gratitude, humility, simplicity, tolerance, purity, gentleness, good faith, and even, surprisingly, humor.Sophisticated, lucid, and full of wit, this modestly titled yet immensely important work provides an indispensable guide to finding what is right and good in everyday life.},

    abstract = {Achieving inclusive eSocieties has prompted a focus on universally designed ICT-solutions. In order to ensure aims and legislations are interpreted in a similar manner, there should be a general consensus on universal design and disability definitions in the professional field. This paper investigates views on disability and universal design in Norwegian expert communities on universal design of ICT through survey research, including which users receive attention. Domain experts are asked on their models (interpretations) of disability, which marginalized user groups they focus on in their work and how they understand “universal design” and related terms. The findings indicate that terminology related to universal design is used differently in the sample. The field “universal design of ICT” is also interpreted in various ways. Further, there seems to be an acquiesce response to most disability views, with right-based disability views being dominant. Unexpectedly, the charity model is also common, as is the social adapted model. The survey measure opposing views related to who should be in charge of assessing a person's need for treatment and assistance: a divergence is indicated between those agreeing with the expert model (professional intervention assessment) versus the empowering model (individual intervention control) with a moderate highly significant negative correlation. Another interesting finding is that three out of the four user groups reported as the most excluded from the Norwegian eSociety receive quite infrequent attention from experts, with median values for receiving focus in “sometimes” or “seldom” categories. The paper contributes with insights into the existing varying interpretations of disability and universal design definitions among Norwegian domain experts, and discusses how different interpretations may affect how inclusion work is implemented. The paper also points out possibly neglected user groups in current practices. Future studies will continue investigations nationally and internationally; particularly on exploring disability focuses.},

The paper presents results from the data analysis for each sector, along with statistical tests regarding the main different issues related to each of the sectors, such as: government and law, industry and techniques, academy and education. The concern about accessibility law is poor even amongst people from government sector. The analyses have also pointed out that the academy has not been addressing accessibility training accordingly. The knowledge about proper techniques to produce accessible contents is better than other sectors', but still limited in industry. Stronger investments in training and in the promotion of consciousness about the law may be pointed as the most important tools to help a more effective policy on Web accessibility in Brazil.},

    abstract = {His paper presents a tool facilitating developers of user interfaces (UIs) to experience accessibility limitations that can be posed from various disabilities during the interaction of impaired users with their developments. In this respect, various aspects of visual, hearing, physical and cognitive impairments have been modelled through filters providing approximate, yet, realistic simulations over them. These filters have formed the basis for the developed tool, which can be used either on its own (as a standalone application), or be embedded in the NetBeans Integrated Development Environment. The tool, named DIAS, allows for impairment simulations to be performed over Java, mobile and web applications. Moreover, it integrates two of the most common assistive technologies (ATs), namely a screen reader and a magnifier. As a result, developers of UIs can not only experience how interaction would be affected from various impairments, but they can also understand how their developments would be perceived by impaired users through an AT. This work aims to provide an integrated, practical solution for impairment simulation, which could be easily adopted by developers, thus realistically increasing the possibilities for the future development of interactive applications that are more accessible to users with disabilities.

Little evidence exists that these exercises have a positive effect on either attitudes or behaviour but, despite this, they are used extensively in disability awareness training, both for children and adults. It is argued in this paper that by individualising and medicalising disability, and by focusing excessively on problems and difficulties, simulation exercises provide false and misleading information, and inculcate negative, rather than positive, attitudes towards disabled people. It is suggested that simulation exercises fail to simulate impairment correctly, and address neither the coping strategies and skills disabled people develop in living with impairment, nor the cumulative social and psychological effect of encountering social and physical barriers over a lifetime. Rather than using simulation as a means of attempting to understand the experience of disability, the paper concludes by advocating the use of disability equality t...},
